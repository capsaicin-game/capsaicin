### Logic for Setting up the game


## Players
(after selecting their color, color selection should be done before the game even starts)
each player is assigned a random order for the first turn.
Each player is given 10$, a red, blue, and yellow pepper, and 3 extra action tiles.
(move one extra space, backtrack once, plant one extra pepper)

## RECIPES // FARMERS MARKET // PLAQUES // AUCTION

Set up recipies based on the number of players
Set up number of farmers market morning && afternoon stacks
set up plaques, 3 for secondary, 3 for brown, 2 for white, 2 for black, 2 for ghost
Set up an auction deck a stack of Pepper[]
